"""
Core Protocol Interfaces.

This module defines the architectural boundaries of the system using Python Protocols.
It establishes the contracts for:
  - Global Planning (Tier-1): High-level multi-agent pathfinding.
  - Local Planning (Tier-2): Low-level single-agent detours.
  - Task Allocation: Assigning goals to agents.
  - Conflict Resolution: Decentralized agent-agent deconfliction logic.
  - Human Prediction: Forecasting dynamic obstacle positions.

These interfaces ensure that the simulation loop remains decoupled from specific algorithm implementations.
