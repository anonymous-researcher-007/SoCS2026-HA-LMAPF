    """
    Lightweight PIBT-style conflict resolver (depth-2 push, no recursion).

    On a desired move for agent i:
      1) If no imminent conflict -> proceed.
      2) If vertex conflict with blocking agent j at desired cell:
            Try to "push" j to move to its best alternative neighbor (including WAIT)
            that reduces its distance to its own goal (or keeps it minimal), and does not
            immediately conflict with other agents.
         If push feasible -> allow i to proceed (we assume j will yield by moving away).
         Else -> WAIT (or optionally side-step, but kept simple).

    Notes:
      - This resolver does NOT actually command the other agent; it only decides whether
        the current agent should proceed, using a conservative feasibility check.
      - Deterministic: fixed tie-breaks; no RNG.
