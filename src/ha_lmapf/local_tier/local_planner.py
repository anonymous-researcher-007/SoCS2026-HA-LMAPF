"""
Local A* Planner for Tier-2 reactive pathfinding.

This planner is used for local detours when the global plan is blocked
by dynamic obstacles (humans).

Supports two safety modes matching the paper's constraints:
  - Hard Safety (default): B_r(H_t) cells are impassable barriers.
    Agents MUST NOT enter the safety buffer (paper's strict constraint).
  - Soft Safety: B_r(H_t) cells incur high cost but are passable.
    Prevents permanent deadlock when humans surround an agent.

        Plan a path from start to goal, avoiding blocked cells.

        In hard safety mode, blocked cells cannot be traversed at all.
        In soft safety mode, blocked cells can be traversed at high cost.

        When guidance_cells is provided (remaining cells from the current
        global TimedPath), cells outside that set incur an extra
        GUIDANCE_DEVIATION_COST per step. This biases A* to stay close to
        the original global guidance when a safe on-path detour exists,
        while still routing freely when the guidance path is fully blocked.

        Args:
            env: The environment providing is_free() checks for static walls.
            start: Starting cell (row, col).
            goal: Target cell (row, col).
            blocked: Set of cells to avoid (dynamic obstacles, safety buffers).
            guidance_cells: Optional set of cells from the current global path
                            (from current step onward). Off-path cells get a
                            small extra cost to prefer path-aligned detours.
