    Tier-2 per-agent controller implementing a Sense-Plan-Act loop:

    1) Follow next step from global timed plan (Tier-1) as a guidance policy.
    2) Human-aware safety: inflate visible human cells by safety_radius to create forbidden set.
       If desired move enters forbidden set, IMMEDIATELY trigger local replanning.
    3) If no global plan exists, use local planner to navigate to goal.
    4) Resolve imminent agent-agent conflicts via ConflictResolver (token / priority rules).

    Safety Modes:
    - hard_safety=True (default): Agents MUST NOT enter B_r(H_t).
      The inflated safety buffer is an absolute barrier per the paper's constraint:
          s_i(t) not in B_r(H_t)  for all i in {1, ..., k}
      If no path exists avoiding the buffer, the agent WAITs.
    - hard_safety=False: Safety buffer is a high-cost soft constraint.
      Agents can path through human zones when no alternative exists
      (prevents permanent deadlock at the cost of safety violations).
